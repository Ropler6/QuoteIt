# QuoteIt
https://quoteit.onrender.com/

A website for storing your favourite quotes of you and your friends!

Below you will find a short explaination on how to use it.


## App
`/app` is the page of the app. Here you can add quotes and see quotes made by you or by other people. You can view more information about a quote by clicking the eye button next to it. There you may see the tags associated with the quote, the people mentioned in it and its creation date. You can mention other users, which are your friends, to appear at the `by` section by writing their names (separated by commas) in the `Mentions` input field.


## Tags
`/tags` is the page in which you manage tag creation and membership. You create tags by typing out their name in the `Tag name` input field and clicking `Create`. To add people to your tag, click the eye icon next to the tag in the `Tags you joined` section. Copy the hash and send it to others. To join a tag, put the tag hash in the corresponding field and click `Join`.


## Menu
`/menu` shows general information about your account. It displays your name, the amount of quotes you have created and are mentioned in and the amount of tags you are a member of. Friend request info is displayed in the bottom section of the page: incoming friend requests on the left (which can be accepted/declined individually) and your list of friends. To send a friend request to another user, simply put their name in the `Username` input field and click `Send friend request`.


## Notes
* When creating a quote, you are automatically added to its mentions.
* You may only add/remove tags to quotes you own. The same applies to deleting quotes.
